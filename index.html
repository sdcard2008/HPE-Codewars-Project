            <h2 class = "sub-head">2. What IS cyber security?</h2>
            <p class="why-p">As you just saw from the above example , it's pretty easy to gather information about you. I literally wrote three lines of code for this to work.  Dont worry about 
                the example , as i am NOT collecting any of your personal data. You can check my source code. So , the textbook definition of "Cyber Security" is :
                <br/> <span class="info">Computer security, cybersecurity, or information technology security (IT security) is the protection of computer systems and networks from information disclosure, theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide.</span><br/>
                Now , Cyber Security is very relevant lately , as we are a lot more active in the internet than the early era (1983 - 2000). Hackers are getting
                very advanced at their techniques of getting your IP , (Which I used in my example) , backdoor access to your computer , 
                installing spywares , malwares and viruses in your computer. So is the technology of anti - viruses are evoloving. A average of 2,200 cyber attack happens
                in a single DAY. So , this is the right time to get cautious.

            <h2 class = "sub-head">2. One question... HOW?</h2>

            <p class = "why-p">
                Some examples of techniques are:<br/><br/>
                1- Phishing : First they send you a fake email (Having a link in this type of emails are VERY high). After a unsuspecting
                user clicks the link , they either steal your information or the computer gets affected by a virus. (Probably a spyware).<br/><br/>
                How to avoid phishing: Dont , in any circumstances , click a link from a untrusted source. In case of email , check if the
                email adress is from the company before doing anything. Like for example , a fake amazon email may come from amazQn@amazQn.com. ,<br/><br/>

                2- Key Logging: This type of software records every keystroke you do.

                <br/><br/>

                How to prevent Key Logging : It's almost same for every type of attacks , DONT CLICK WEIRD LINKS!!

            <h2 class="sub-head">Tips on how to stay safe on the internet</h2>
            <p class="why-p">
                Some tips for staying safe on the internet:
                <br/>
                <br/>
                Use a VPN : VPN sounds kind of sophisticated , but it really isn't. This piece of technology changes your IP adress , thus
                hiding your location even after some kind of attack happens.
                <br/>
                Choosing a strong password: Normally when you register in a website , google recommends you a strong password. ENABLE THAT. This will
                make password cracking much harder. 
                <br/>
                Dont react to scam calls and phishing mails: Scam calls are easily identified if you understand what they are
                saying you to do. For example , giving your bank OTP to someone is never secure , unless you trust who 
                you are talking to. My father was scammed too , and have been cautious ever since. And as per as the phishing mails ,
                i told you earlier about that.
